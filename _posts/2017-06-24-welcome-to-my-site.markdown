Thanks for visiting my website. I am studying programming and data management; I'll be posting some of my more interesting projects here! I'm confident using HTML/CSS (although this site is created with the Jekyll RubyGem ... mostly as a placeholder to get my domain live). I'm most comfortable coding in Python and Javascript, although I'm constantly looking to expand my skills. Shoot me an email with any feedback you have! Thanks.
